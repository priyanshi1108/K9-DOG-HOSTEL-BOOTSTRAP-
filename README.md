<h3>Overview</h3>

This project is not a fully responsive but will improve it in future and it is a website developed for a K9 dog hostel as a real-world requirement by my neighbor. The website is built using the Bootstrap framework, which I learned and applied during the development process. The website provides information about the dog hostel, its services, and features, ensuring a professional and user-friendly experience.

<h3>Features</h3>

	•	Bootstrap Framework: Leveraged the power of Bootstrap to create a clean and modern layout with minimal custom CSS. Bootstrap’s grid system, components, and utilities were extensively used to streamline the development process.
	•	Assets Folder: All the images used in the website are stored in the assets folder, making it easy to manage and update visual content as needed.
	•	User-Friendly Navigation: Intuitive navigation and well-structured content make it easy for visitors to find the information they need about the hostel’s services.

<h3>Project Structure</h3>

	•	HTML Files: The core structure of the website is contained in the main HTML files, each representing a different page of the website.
	•	CSS Files: While Bootstrap handles most of the styling, any additional custom styles are included in the accompanying CSS files.
	•	Assets Folder: Contains all images and other media assets used throughout the website.

Experience

Working on this project was a fantastic learning experience. It provided me with practical insights into how Bootstrap can be effectively used to build aesthetically pleasing websites. The process also deepened my understanding of web development best practices, particularly in managing assets and organizing code in a real-world project setting.
